Jenkins does a great job in his attempt to clarify the difference between History and the past. By using examples such as reading versus experiencing, women, and the analogy of the window, Jenkins paints a concise picture of the relationship between history or historiography and the past. 
He then follows this up by explaining three issues surrounding history. During these explanations, Jenkins explanations were not written as clear as I would have hoped. The topic is interesting but, due to the lack of clarity, harder to understand. It took a few re-reads to clarify what he was he was trying to explain and then to understand the explanations themselves. To give him credit, Jenkins does recap his arguments after each one. It acts as an “explain it like I’m five” addition of each statement. 
Jenkins is arguing that while the past is consistent, History is a fluid description of it. History is more of an eye of the beholder situation. He argues that this has the problems associated with the inability to find an unarguably true statement of events and the usability of history to fit agendas. He claims that this identifier of history also lends a freedom with the ability to view history without the need to rely on antiquated views and to re-evaluate the claims made to power through certain lenses of history.
